    "bio": "I am a hard-working, dedicated Software Engineer with a wide variety of experience and skill sets that allow me to come up with unique and interesting perspectives, as well as tackle new challenges that I have never come across. Coming from a heavily automotive technology related background, my brain is hard-wired for diagnosing and solving complex problems to come up with various solutions. My value lies in my ability to dive into any technological problem head first, and being able to collaborate with other team members to ensure work productivity."
